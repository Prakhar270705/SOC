**Project ID-22: Competitive Programming**
**Mentor:** Himanshu Shete

As part of this project, I followed the weekly resource sheets and problem sets shared by my mentor. In addition, I supplemented my learning with extra practice from Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet. Here is a summary of my week-wise progress:

---

### **Week 1: Foundations and Core Concepts**

* **Time and Space Complexity:**
  Learned the fundamental concepts and analyzed the complexities of standard algorithms like loops, sorting, and searching.

* **Arrays:**
  Focused on improving problem-solving skills by practicing a wide variety of array questions, including some involving unique algorithms.

* **Sorting Algorithms:**
  Studied and implemented:

  * Bubble Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Selection Sort

* **Binary Search:**
  Practiced standard binary search problems, as well as variations like searching in rotated arrays and problems involving large number calculations.

* **Two Pointers:**
  Understood the two-pointer technique and applied it in problems involving arrays and strings.

---

### **Week 2: Strings and Recursion**

* **Strings:**
  Practiced problems shared by the mentor to strengthen string manipulation and pattern-based logic.

* **Recursion:**
  Learned core concepts of recursion and practiced a few problems to build a strong foundation.

---

### **Week 3: Linked Lists and Pointers**

* **Linked Lists:**
  Understood the different types (singly, doubly, circular), their structure, and common operations. Practiced related problems to reinforce learning.

* **Pointers:**
  Had a good understanding from CS101. Applied pointer concepts while working with linked lists and recursive functions.

* **Arrays:**
  Continued practicing some array problems to maintain consistency and fluency.

---

### **Week 4: Stack, Queue, and Bit Manipulation**

* **Stacks and Queues:**
  Learned the concepts, operations, and types of stacks and queues using mentor resources. While I couldn’t practice problems due to time constraints, I gained a conceptual understanding (beyond basic LIFO/FIFO learned earlier).

* **Bit Manipulation:**
  Had prior exposure from CS101. Deepened my understanding using the [CP-Algorithms Bit Manipulation](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/bit-manipulation.html) article and other mentor-provided resources. Practiced the assigned problems to strengthen implementation skills.

Overall, I’ve made steady progress each week by actively engaging with the resources, practicing problems, and supplementing with external sheets. This project has significantly boosted my understanding of core DSA topics and improved my problem-solving approach.
